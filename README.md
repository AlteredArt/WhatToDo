# WhatToDo
WhatToDo is a Angular ToDo App that utilizes the json placeholder Api to fetch data for the initial list and persist it to the UI.
You can complete a Todo by clicking the checkbox, or remove a Todo by clicking the X. Feel free to add your own todos.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
